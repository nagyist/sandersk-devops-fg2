<p>The monitoring infrastructure is perhaps the most foreign element in the devops stack. &nbsp;Of all the parts of the software infrastructure, this was perhaps the most opaque. &nbsp;A disk would fill up, the monitoring system would alert the systems group, and they would quietly fix it without the developer being any the wiser.</p>

<p>However, as more of the traditional admin functions spread to other parts of the organization, there's increasing need for developers to view the monitoring infrastructure as just another part of the app. &nbsp;In addition to providing the sorts of critical alerts on failures, many monitoring tools are tailored to the application stack and can be used to pinpoint performance bottlenecks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of these systems have two components: a client and a server. &nbsp;The client is an agent that runs on the server you want to monitor. &nbsp;Whether it's a daeomon or a cron job, the client periodically reports back key metrics to the central server. &nbsp;The server provides the reporting interface, notification systems, and other functions that are required to smoothly maintain a large number of systems.</p>

<p>Here are some monitoring tools you might encounter: &nbsp;</p>
