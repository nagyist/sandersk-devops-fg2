<p>The monitoring infrastructure is perhaps the most foreign element in the devops stack. &nbsp;Of all the parts of the software infrastructure, this was perhaps the most opaque. &nbsp;A disk would fill up, the monitoring system would alert the systems group, and they would quietly fix it without the developer being any the wiser.</p>

<p>However, as more of the traditional admin functions spread to other parts of the organization, there's increasing need for developers to view the monitoring infrastructure as just another part of the app. &nbsp;In addition to providing the sorts of critical alerts on failures, many monitoring tools are tailored to the application stack and can be used to pinpoint performance bottlenecks. &nbsp;</p>
