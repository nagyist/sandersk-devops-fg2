<p>The version control system is the heart of the new development process. At the most basic level, a VCS allows developers to keep track of all the changes made to a set of files and be able to roll back to specific points in time in case something screws up. In some systems, like <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>, the code is checked out and then checked back in from a central repository. If there is a conflict between two developers' files (for example, both of them edited the same line of code), then the two version must be merged together. This can be a painful process.</p>

<p>In contrast, distributed version control systems (DVCS), like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, are the heart of most new style development processes. Rather than having a central, master copy that makes it difficult and expensive to merge a lot of contributions from developers, a DVCS makes it simple (well, simpler!) to have multiple people all working on the same codebase simultaneously in different <em>branches</em>, and that these branches can be easily merged back together in a <em>master</em> branch.</p>

<p>While there are many different work styles, such as <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git flow</a>, the basic DVCS process is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there is an agreed upon master repository, which is often on a public service like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a data-original-title="" href="https://bitbucket.org/" title="">BitBucket</a> or an internal server like <a data-original-title="" href="https://www.gitlab.com/" title="">GitLab</a> or <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a></li>
	<li>each developer clones the master repository to his or her local machine</li>
	<li>the developer creates a new branch, usually for a specific feature</li>
	<li>the developer makes commits against the local copy</li>
	<li>once the feature is done, he or she merges the branch back into the master branch and pushes the change back to the master</li>
	<li>other developers pull from the and merge their branch</li>
	<li>the merged copy preserves the full version history of all the distributed copies</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these coordination functions, most version control system also offer a feature called a <em>hook</em>. A hook is a process that fires once a specific event, like a commit, happens to the repository. Hooks can be defined in the repo itself, but also in the hosting service. For example, GitHub lets you define &quot;service&quot; hooks that are called whenever a specific event occurs. These hooks are the tie-in to the continuous integration (CI server).</p>
