<p>The CI server's executes a specific action on a repository whenever it receives a commit hook. For example, is a developer makes a commit against repository called foo, the CI server might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>clone down a local copy of foo</li>
	<li>execute foo's test suites (see the section on application stacks &nbsp;for more about this)</li>
	<li>if the tests fail, the CI server sends an alert to the development team and halts the process</li>
	<li>if the test suite passes, the CI server might deploy the code to a staging or even production server</li>
</ul>
