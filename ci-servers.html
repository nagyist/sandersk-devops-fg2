<p>Software legend Martin Fowler defines&nbsp;<a data-original-title="" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" title="">continuous deployment</a>&nbsp;as &quot;a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.&quot; Fowler's seminal article defines the key best practices as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maintain a Single Source Repository.</li>
	<li>Automate the Build</li>
	<li>Make Your Build Self-Testing</li>
	<li>Everyone Commits To the Mainline Every Day</li>
	<li>Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine</li>
	<li>Keep the Build Fast</li>
	<li>Test in a Clone of the Production Environment</li>
	<li>Make it Easy for Anyone to Get the Latest Executable</li>
	<li>Everyone can see what's happening</li>
	<li>Automate Deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>The CI server's executes a specific action on a repository whenever it receives a commit hook. For example, is a developer makes a commit against repository called foo, the CI server might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>clone down a local copy of foo</li>
	<li>execute foo's test suites (see the section on application stacks &nbsp;for more about this)</li>
	<li>if the tests fail, the CI server sends an alert to the development team and halts the process</li>
	<li>if the test suite passes, the CI server might deploy the code to a staging or even production server</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few of the CI servers you might encounter:</p>
