<h1>Language stack</h1>

<p>The profusion of languages and tools is a beautiful thing, but it can be a bit overwhelming to keep up with the developments. &nbsp;T<span style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5em;">he goal of the table below is to map some the key elements in a language ecosystem so that you can quickly cross reference an unfamiliar language stack against one you're familiar with.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if you don't need to know a language in depth, you still might want to install and use some great open source package, so it helps to have an idea of what is what.</p>
