* Intro

* Key Business Drivers.  This section will cover some of the things driving this new shift, like:
  * The need for greater speed / emergent enterprises
  * Need to reduce risk profile in general (maybe wrap Lean in, as well)
  * Cloud is the new default platform (even if it's your own internal cloud)

* Ingredients for success.  This section will cover (at a high level) some of the key things you should do, along with a map of the tools in each category.  The main goal here is to lay down the general principles, but also make a living resource where new tools can go to live.

* Application stacks.  The goal is to product a reference that can map the tools at the application stack.  this is important for the "polyglot programmer" idea that people need to know different things.  For example, I might be a ruby developer that wants to use some open source node tool, so it would be useful to know that "npm" is the equivalent of "bundle install" (for example)

* Exemplars.  This is the heart of it -- people will be able to add their own projects and map out the tools they used.  I can use this as a way to pull in new things.
