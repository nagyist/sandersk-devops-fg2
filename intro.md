# Motivation

DevOps tools are popping up like weeds -- nearly everyday, some new service or tool pops up.  The goal of this project is to (1) catalog all these developments, (2) put them into a useful framework, and (3) document how system development is changing and evolving as the lines between development and operations continues to blur.
