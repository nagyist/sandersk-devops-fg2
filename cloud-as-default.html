<h1>The cloud is the default deployment platform.</h1>

<p>The accelerating transition to cloud-based platforms, and platforms as a service (PaaS) in general, is one of the main drivers of the devops trend. &nbsp;As organizations use these services to take advantage of cost savings or increased speed for launching new projects, the deployment process becomes increasingly focused around tansient, virtual platforms, rather than the traditional servers maintained by an internal IT group. &nbsp;And, even in cases where the virtualization/PaaS solution <strong>is</strong>&nbsp;maintained in an internal cloud, the net effect is much the same: the target is a transient server with an ever changing list of dependencies, backing services, and components specific to your particular application stack.</p>

<p>Here's a list of PaaS and cloud services. &nbsp;I've broken &nbsp;them into two big buckets: whether they're external services that are paid for on a monthly contract, or internal services that put a PaaS veneer on traditional internal IT infrastructure.</p>
