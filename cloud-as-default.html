<h1>The cloud is the default deployment platform.</h1>

<p>The accelerating transition to cloud-based platforms, and platforms as a service (PaaS) in general, is one of the main drivers of the devops trend. &nbsp;Organizations have adopted these services for any of a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cost savings</li>
	<li>Increased speed for launching new projects</li>
	<li>Scalability</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reasons, the modern deployment process has become increasingly focused around transient, virtual platforms, rather than the traditional servers maintained by an internal IT group. &nbsp;And, even in cases where the virtualization/PaaS solution <strong>is</strong>&nbsp;maintained in an internal cloud, the net effect is much the same: the target is a transient server with an ever changing list of dependencies, backing services, and components specific to your particular application stack.</p>

<p>This section is divided into three big parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Traditional cloud providers. &nbsp;These allow you to quickly create storage or computing power as needed.</li>
	<li>PaaS services. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
